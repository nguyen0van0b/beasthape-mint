                <p>A starlit ceremony, two million years ago. Lightning strikes the monolith and the universe fractures. Apes spin off in 10k tribes, distinct but familiar. Every ape is unique. Every ape is beautiful. Every ape is loved, and every ape is family, whatever their differences, wherever they are now.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, at the heart of the shattered multiverse, the <span>PRIMAL HAPES</span> wait for the whole family to return. They wait and they build out their style, they work the Hapewalk, and they plan for a bigger future.</p>
